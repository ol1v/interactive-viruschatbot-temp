# interactive-viruschatbot-temp

A chatbot for MS Teams and Slack checks  URLs, Filehashes and IPs for Malware.

Get an API-key from VirusTotal and use it in project.

As of now, it's only possible to scan URLs, will add filehashes and IPs later but you can use this as a template and modify it as you wish.

# Docs
There's plenty of documentation on how to use the VirusTotal API on their website.
Also microsoft provides great documentation on the bot-builder API.

Start chatting with the bot to get a list of commands.
